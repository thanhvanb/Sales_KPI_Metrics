# Sales_KPI_Metrics
This is a self-study project worked in Excel to build Sales KPI Metrics. In this project, I learnt how to create pivot tables with various calculation formulas and differently interactive charts with lively gradient colors and chart shapes, which are suitable for the using data.
Using charts are: donut, pie, bar, column and line charts. Using colors are more interactive with vivid Hex instead of normal boring shading colors. 
Datasheet are connected with built-in hyperlinks help viewers( stakeholders) easily to connect and understand the data outcome as well as the connection slicers. Data can be easily indicated the difference among date time and consultants conveniently.
